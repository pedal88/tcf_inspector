RESTRUCTORE JSON FILE FOR P, SP, F and SF
This are the purposes, special purposes, features and special features described in the vendor list. I have also added the allowed legal basis from the framework
P1: Consent
P2: Consent, Legitimate Interest
P3: Consent
P4: Consent
P5: Consent
P6: Consent
P7: Consent, Legitimate Interest
P8: Consent, Legitimate Interest
P9: Consent, Legitimate Interest
P10: Consent, Legitimate Interest
SP1: Legitimate Interest
SP2: Legitimate Interest
F1: Legitimate Interest
F2: Legitimate Interest
F3: Legitimate Interest
SF1: Consent
SF2: Consent

The two available legal basises are C (Consent) and LI (Legitimate Interest)

The gvl json describes the legal basis for the purposes in "purposes", "legIntPurposes" and "flexiblePurposes"
The gvl json describes the special purposes in "specialPurposes"
The gvl json describes the features in "features"
The gvl json describes the special features in "specialFeatures"



I want to restructure the gvl json to a simpler format where each P, SP, F and SF is represented by a value where:
No legal basis = 0
C = 1
LI O 2
C or LI = 3

The output should also include vendor_id and vendor_name before all the other fields.

Here is a sample of the original gvl json. Talk to me about this


NEW CUSTOM VENDOR VALUES
I want to be able to add more custom data to each vendor. Should I do this in the modified json files I allready have or separately? What are my options?

This is the scoope and purpose:

In the modified json file, add the following k-v pairs for each vendor:
vendor_type
mbl_audited
vendor_status

vendor_type represents predifined types such as "DSP", "SSP", "Ad Server" etc. One vendor should be able to have multiple types
mbl_audited shold be a boolean where 0 represent not audited and 1 represent audited. The default value should be set to 0
vendor_status can be the values "no", "partner" or "shortlist"

Add a second row of table headers, to group the existing headers in this way
vendor: ID, Name
Custom vendor info: Status, Type, audited
Purposes: P1-P10
Special Purposes: SP1, SP2
Features: F1-F3
Special Features: SF1, SF2
