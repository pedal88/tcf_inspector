This are the purposes, special purposes, features and special features described in the vendor list:
P1
P2
P3
P4
P5
P6
P7
P8
P9
P10
SP1
SP2
F1
F2
F3
SF1
SF2

The two available legal basises are C (Consent) and LI (Legitimate Interest)

The gvl json describes the legal basis for the purposes in "purposes", "legIntPurposes" and "flexiblePurposes"
The gvl json describes the special purposes in "specialPurposes"
The gvl json describes the features in "features"
The gvl json describes the special features in "specialFeatures"

I want to restructure the gvl json to a simpler format where each P, SP, F and SF is represented by a value where:
No legal basis = 0
C = 1
LI O 2
C or LI = 3

The output should also include vendor_id and vendor_name before all the other fields.

Here is a sample of the original gvl json. Talk to me about this
